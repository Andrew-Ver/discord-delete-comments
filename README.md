### A simple program to delete comments you've made on [Discord](https://www.discord.com), utilizing Python's Requests module. It will search for your comment IDs in private conversations or servers that you provide the IDs for, and then send delete requests.  

#### To use:

>- Install requirements.txt with pip, make sure to enter relevant information in the config.yaml file. 
>- User and Server IDs are found by right-clicking on your profile icon and the server icon after enabling "developer mode" in user settings (under advanced settings). 
>- Run delete-comments.py


*Works as of right now, don't intend to maintain it.*
